**Credit Score Classification App**  

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to predict a customer's credit score based on their financial and demographic information. The project uses a Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for the classification task and a Streamlit web application to provide a user-friendly interface for making predictions.

**Dataset**  

The model was trained on the Credit Score Classification Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features, including a customer's income, loan type, and credit history.

**Prerequisites**  

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the project dependencies.

**Setup and Installation**  

   1-Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/Ayaa24/Credit_Score_Classification_System.git

  2-Navigate to the project directory:

     cd Credit_Score_Classification_System

  3-Install the required libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**Running the Application**  

To start the Streamlit web application, simply run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

     streamlit run app.py

This will launch the app in your default web browser, where you can input new data and get a real-time credit score prediction.
